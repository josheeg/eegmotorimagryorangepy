Short Term Fourier transform can be applied to signals to make them more significant to unsupervised training.
Lables may have to be coppied over if Time and number of records same... 
Neuronetwork seems to be the best model.
The Data comes in and out of the widget as a row signal and can be concatinated to many rows then transposed for many columns to train on

samples 100000 to output . array x= 202 , y= 501  stft nperseg=1000 fs =10e3 = 1000 202 time  y 501 freq n val amp
transpose to have sample time be on y axis and frequency power be x 

201 points in time 500 samples to 1 out? labeling may be manual

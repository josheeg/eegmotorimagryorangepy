 Motor imaging EEG signal recognition is an important and challenging research problem in human-computer interaction. 

A motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) creates a path through which the brain interacts with the external environment by recording and processing electroencephalograph (EEG) signals made by imagining the movement of a particular limb.

As the relevant rhythmic signals during motor imagery are divided into μ rhythm signal of 8–12 Hz and β rhythm signal of 13–30 Hz 

Deep Learning (DL) models have gained popularity for EEG classification as they provide a solution for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal features in the signals.

# Convolution Neuronetwork:
This allows DL models to learn the EEG Signals directly and important spatio-temporal features of the EEG signals, leading to improved accuracy in motor imagery detection.

Saving these biosignal models is important they can take a lot of time to train and smaller processor to use to predict.

# df to csv:
"Working with data often requires you to move between different formats. One of the most common data transformations you may find yourself needing is to convert DataFrame to CSV. The Comma Separated Values (CSV) format is universally accepted and can be opened in numerous platforms like Excel, Google Sheets, and various database management systems. In Python, the Pandas library makes this process straightforward and efficient."
